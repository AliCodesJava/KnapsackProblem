# Coding Challenge : Knapsack Problem in 4 different paradyms & languages

### About

This repo holds the Knapsack Problem implemented in 4 different paradigms and 4 different languages.
Each paradigm has 1 or 2 solving methods (for ex. dynamic and brute force for the Object-Oriented solution).

Paradigm | Language
-------- | --------
Object-Oriented | Java
Concurrent | Golang
Logical | Prolog
Imperative | Scheme

Through the implementations of this challenge in the different paradigms, the following goals are fulfilled :
1. Implementing the different major paradigms to use what has been learned
2. Develop a deeper understanding of those paradigms
