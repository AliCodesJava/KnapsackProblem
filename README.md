# Coding Challenge : Knapsack Problem implemented in 4 different paradigms & languages

### About the challenge

This repo holds the Knapsack Problem implemented in 4 different paradigms each with a particular language.

For each paradigm used, there is 1 or 2 different techniques for solving the problem (for e.g. dynamic and brute force for the object-oriented solution).

### Paradigms & languages used

Paradigm | Language
-------- | --------
Object-Oriented | Java
Concurrent | Golang
Logical | Prolog
Functional | Scheme

### Goal

Through this challenge, the goals fulfilled are :
1. To develop a deeper understanding of those paradigms
2. To learn (or get more comfortable with) different programming languages
