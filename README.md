# Coding Challenge : Knapsack Problem in 4 different paradigms & languages

### About the challenge

This repo holds the Knapsack Problem implemented in 4 different paradigms each with a particular language.
Each paradigm has 1 or 2 solving methods implemented (for ex. dynamic and brute force for the Object-Oriented solution).

### Paradigms & languages used

Paradigm | Language
-------- | --------
Object-Oriented | Java
Concurrent | Golang
Logical | Prolog
Functional | Scheme

### Goals achieved

Through this challenge, the goals fulfilled are :
1. Develop a deeper understanding of those paradigms
2. Learn or get more comfortable at different programming languages
